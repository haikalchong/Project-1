# Pokemon Hero
<br>

The live demo to the website can be accessed [here](https://flourishing-quokka-df4a64.netlify.app/).

*Note: This is a bootcamp project where a web application was created with interactive elements (implemented with JavaScript). Main technologies used are Bootstrap, CSS, HTML and JavaScript*

## Project Summary
 To create a map website that will improve and provide convenience to peoples lives and most importantly, to put a smile on their face.

### Project Context

Pokemon Hero is a map application that is able to search for whichever cuisine of food that you are craving that is closest to you. It also has the ability to search for places anywhere in Singapore. Be it a random HDB block or some place in Singapore that are lands unknown to you, we got your back. Also to make it a fun and enjoyable experience for users of Pokemon Hero, we also added a function whereby Pokemon between generation one to four, will randomly spawn anywhere on the map(within Singapore) that the users can capture and be like a Pokemon Trainer. 

### Target Audience

The target audience is whoever is in Singapore. As long as they are within Singapore borders, they can be a Pokemon Hero!

### Organisational Goals

The goal of this web application is to make using the map a fun and interactive experience whereby people of all ages can enjoy.

### User Goals
The goal of the user will be either to fill their belly with some scrumptous food that is nearby to them, or to find an area in Singapore that they have yet to explore or to have the strongest Pokedex.

### Justification for the App

Most maps are boring and just get you to places. I want to change that. Have you every experienced walking while using a map and find yourself just staring blankly at the screen? Pokemon Hero aims to change that and whilst going to your destination, who knows, you might just encounter a legendary Pokemon!

## UI/UX

### Strategy

**Organisation**
* Objective: To fill people's lives with joy.

**User**
* Objective: To get to places/food locations/know the weather/capture Pokemon

* Needs: A pokedex to store the pokemon which would not disappear upon refresh/ Food places within a 5km radius / Location of a postal code/ Weather forecast

* Demographic:As long as two feet are planted in the little red dot, they are part of the demographic

* Pain point: Most maps are boring and exclude certain information(weather forecast etc).

**Font Choice**: 'Chakra Petch', 'Inconsolata',

**Icons and Markers**: All icons and markers are chosen whereby they will be highly visible to the user and also contrast against the map.
